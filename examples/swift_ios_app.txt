Build an iOS Weather App with SwiftUI

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
Create a native iOS weather application using SwiftUI that displays current weather conditions, forecasts, and weather alerts for multiple locations with a beautiful, modern interface.

CORE FEATURES:

1. Weather Data Display
   - Current weather conditions (temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure)
   - Hourly forecast for next 24 hours
   - 7-day weather forecast
   - Weather condition icons and animations
   - Sunrise/sunset times
   - UV index and air quality

2. Location Management
   - Current location weather (using CoreLocation)
   - Search and add multiple cities
   - Save favorite locations
   - Swipe between saved locations
   - Delete saved locations

3. Weather Alerts
   - Push notifications for severe weather
   - Alert badges on location cards
   - Detailed alert information
   - Custom alert preferences

4. User Interface
   - SwiftUI-based modern design
   - Dark mode support
   - Smooth animations and transitions
   - Pull-to-refresh functionality
   - Loading states and error handling
   - Accessibility support (VoiceOver, Dynamic Type)

5. Data Persistence
   - Core Data for saved locations
   - UserDefaults for preferences
   - Cache weather data for offline viewing
   - Background refresh

6. Settings
   - Temperature units (Celsius/Fahrenheit)
   - Wind speed units
   - Notification preferences
   - Privacy settings
   - About screen

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:

Language & Framework:
- Swift 5.9+
- SwiftUI for UI
- Combine for reactive programming
- iOS 16.0+ deployment target
- Xcode 15.0+

Architecture:
- MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern
- Repository pattern for data layer
- Dependency injection
- Protocol-oriented design

APIs & Services:
- Weather API (OpenWeatherMap or WeatherAPI.com)
- Core Location for GPS
- User Notifications framework
- Background App Refresh

Data Persistence:
- Core Data for location storage
- UserDefaults for settings
- Keychain for API keys
- File system for cached images

Networking:
- URLSession with async/await
- Codable for JSON parsing
- Custom API client with error handling
- Network reachability monitoring

DESIGN PATTERNS:

1. MVVM Architecture
   - ViewModels for business logic
   - Models for data structures
   - Views for UI components
   - Services for external dependencies

2. Coordinator Pattern (optional)
   - Navigation flow management
   - Deep linking support

3. Repository Pattern
   - Abstract data sources
   - Local and remote data handling
   - Caching strategy
